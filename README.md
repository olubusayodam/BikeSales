#  Project Name: Analysis and Visualization of Bike Sales Data

----
# Project Objective: 
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the bike sales data to gain insights into customer preferences, income patterns, and age groups most interested in purchasing bikes. By cleaning the dataset, standardizing categorical variables, and creating age brackets, we aim to provide valuable information for businesses to make data-driven decisions and enhance sales strategies.

# Data Transformation:
The data cleaning process involved the following steps:
1. Removing duplicates: Identified and removed 26 duplicate values from the dataset.
2. Handling empty values: Checked for blank or empty values in each column, and fortunately, no such values were found.
3. Standardizing categorical variables: Replaced inconsistent values in the Marital Status and Gender columns to ensure uniformity and accuracy.
4. Creating Age Categories: Introduced a new column called "Age Bracket" using the IF statement to categorize ages into four distinct brackets, providing a consolidated representation of age for analysis.

# Findings & Recommendation:
1. Average Income by Gender: The analysis revealed that the average income of male bike purchasers is higher than that of female bike purchasers. Businesses can tailor marketing strategies to target high-income male customers and explore opportunities to attract more female customers.
2. Number of Purchases by Distance Covered: The analysis indicated that customers with varying commuting distances show interest in bike purchases. Businesses can target specific commuting distance segments with tailored promotions or offers to cater to their preferences.
3. Age Distribution of Bike Purchasers: The analysis showed that certain age brackets are more likely to purchase bikes. Companies can focus on marketing efforts and product features that appeal to these specific age groups to boost sales.
By performing data analysis and visualization on the bike sales data, we obtained valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. The clean and transformed dataset, along with the pivot tables, provided a clear and concise representation of the key findings. These insights can empower businesses to make informed decisions, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction in the bike market. Data analysis continues to play a crucial role in driving effective decision-making and problem-solving processes across various industries.
